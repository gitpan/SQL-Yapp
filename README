SQL-Yapp - Yet Another Perl Preprocessor for SQL

The SQL::Yapp module is an embedded preprocessor for Perl that lets
you use native SQL expressions in Perl that can directly be used with
e.g. DBI.  Perl variables can be interpolated easily, and SQL
substatements and expressions can be parsed separately and used in
larger expressions.  The goal is to make SQL injections impossible
while using a natural SQL language syntax directly in Perl.

By parsing all embedded SQL statements, this package also provides
compile-time syntax checking of SQL.

Example:

   my %values= (
       title  => 'The Language Construction Kit',
       author => 'Mark Rosenfelder',
       isbn13 => '978-0984470006',
   );
   sqlDo{ INSERT INTO book SET %values };

The module has some capabilities to normalise SQL statements and
translate between SQL dialects to ease porting.

Although the current SQL parser is far from complete, most things and
many extensions already works.  The man page gives an extensive
overview of what is implemented.

The major goals are security (i.e., lack of SQL injections), ease of
use, and concise and natural mixing of Perl and SQL.  Completeness or
efficiency comes second.
