SQL-Yapp - Yet Another Perl Preprocessor for SQL

The SQL::Yapp module is an embedded preprocessor for Perl that lets
you use native SQL expressions in Perl that can directly be used with
e.g. DBI.  Perl variables can be interpolated easily, and SQL
substatements and expressions can be parsed separately and used in
larger expressions.  The goal is to make SQL injections impossible
while using a natural SQL language syntax directly in Perl.

This package also provides basic compile-time syntax checking of SQL.

Example:

   my %values= (
       title  => 'The Language Construction Kit',
       author => 'Mark Rosenfelder',
       isbn13 => '978-0984470006',
   );
   $dbh->prepare(sql{ INSERT INTO book SET %values });

The module has some capabilities to normalise SQL statements and
translate between SQL dialects to ease porting.  Currently, only
INSERT ... SET statements are normalised to INSERT ... VALUES (but this
is already quite handy for Perl, as shown in the example).

Although the current SQL parser is far from complete, the basic stuff
with many extensions already works.  The man page gives an extensive
overview of what is implemented.

The major goals are security and ease of use, rather than completeness
or efficiency.  (Of course, it is tried not to mess up completely.)
